# OpportunMediaPlayer

A local media player (Avalonia desktop UI + FFmpeg-based engine) whose key feature is routing
different audio tracks from one file to different audio output devices simultaneously.

- `OMP.Lib` — the playback engine. No UI framework dependency. Stays that way.
- `OMP.Ui` — Avalonia UI, DI composition root, hosts `OMP.Lib` via `IMediaSessionRegistry`.
- `OMP.Lib.Tests` — xUnit. Covers pure/extracted logic only (see Testing below).

## Member ordering

Within a class: properties before fields, grouped by descending accessibility (public →
internal → protected → private); constants come last within the private-field group;
constructor after fields; methods last, also ordered by descending accessibility.

`stylecop.json` + `.editorconfig` enforce the accessibility-grouping part (SA1202) at build
time. They do **not** enforce properties-before-fields or constants-last — StyleCop's SA1201/
SA1203/SA1214 have a hardcoded fields-before-properties, constants-first kind order that can't
be reconfigured to match this project's convention (confirmed by testing: those rules flagged
our own correctly-ordered files), so they're deliberately switched off. Apply that part by hand
— when writing or reviewing a class, that's the part to double check.

## OMP.Lib stays host-agnostic

`OMP.Lib` must not know about config files, hosting, or dev/debug conveniences — those are
`OMP.Ui` concerns. If a feature needs a knob (e.g. a debug-only behavior toggle), define the
options type and the config binding in `OMP.Ui`, and have `OMP.Ui` push the *result* into
`OMP.Lib` (constructor args, method calls, event subscriptions) rather than having `OMP.Lib`
read configuration itself.

Constants that are genuinely engine tuning (buffering, sync tolerances, algorithm parameters —
see `MediaSession`, `AudioPipeline`, `AudioSpeedProcessor`) are a different case: they can live
in `OMP.Lib` as `const` fields even though they're also arguably "config", because moving them
requires understanding playback-loop or resampling internals to change safely. Don't confuse
"engine tuning constant" with "host/debug configuration" — the former stays as a hardcoded
constant unless a specific need to tune it externally comes up; the latter is always bound from
`OMP.Ui`'s config and pushed in.

## Threading

Playback worker threads (demux/audio/video/render) are identified by `PipelineWorkerRole`
(`OMP.Lib/Threading/PipelineWorkerRole.cs`), not raw strings — gives compile-time-checked
identity and doubles as a tag for future structured logging. Don't reach for empty
subclass-per-role types to get "stronger" identity than an enum already provides; that's
inheritance used for labeling, not behavior, and is the pattern to avoid here.

`PlaybackClock` locks its state with a plain `Lock`/short critical section (field reads/writes,
no I/O, no blocking, no nested locks) — that's the correct, unremarkable use of a lock, not a
smell. Only worry about locking when critical sections do real work, block, or nest.

## Resource lifetime

Classes that own something live (a `DispatcherTimer`, a subscription to another object's event,
a native-backed resource like `WriteableBitmap`) implement `IDisposable` and get disposed
explicitly by whoever owns their lifetime (e.g. `MainWindow.OnClosed` disposes
`FullscreenController` and `VideoRenderSurface`). Don't rely on GC/finalizers for these.

## Testing

`OMP.Lib.Tests` covers logic that's genuinely unit-testable without FFmpeg or a real audio
device: `PlaybackClock`, `AudioSpeedProcessor`, `PipelineWorker`. `MediaSession` /
`MediaSessionRegistry` need a real file and real FFmpeg native libs to construct, so they're not
unit tested — verify those manually. Avalonia-side classes (`FullscreenController`,
`VideoRenderSurface`, `WindowFactory`) are written with plain constructor dependencies so
Avalonia-headless tests can be added later, but that test host isn't wired up yet.
